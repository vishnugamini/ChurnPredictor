# Customer Retention Prediction using ANN

Customer Retention Prediction using ANN is a deep learning project that aims to predict customer churn (attrition) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. By analyzing various customer-related data, this project helps identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as demographics, usage patterns, and customer behavior. The dataset is available at [dataset-link](https://example-dataset-url.com).

## Features

- Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Training an ANN model to predict customer churn.
- Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the prediction results.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
